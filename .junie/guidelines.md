# Project Guidelines

This is a collection of Vue.js components for the Graduate College.

Accessibility is the first priority.

Code conventions:

- Use 4 spaces for indentation.
- Avoid obvious comments when the code is self-explanatory.
- Keep chatting terse and to the point.

[VueUse](https://vueuse.org/functions.html) is available to reduce boilerplate.

When creating Vue components:

- Use the composition API.
- Place the script tag at the top of the file.
- with `defineProps`, use TypeScript `type` for props, and then `withDefaults` to set default values.
